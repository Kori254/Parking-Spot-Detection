# Parking-Spot-Detection

This project aims to detect parking occupancy in a parking lot using computer vision techniques. The goal is to determine whether each parking space is "Empty" or "Occupied" by analyzing images of the parking lot and an empty reference image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib 

How to Run

    Ensure your directory structure is correct:

    Make sure parking.py, parking_slots.jpg, and empty_parking_lot.jpg are in the same directory.

    Update the script with correct paths (if necessary):

    Ensure the paths to the images in parking.py are correct.

    Run the script:

    Execute the following command in your terminal:

    bash

python parking.py
